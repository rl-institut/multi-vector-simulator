"""
Parameter constants
===================

Defines the strings of different json parameters
Using variables rather than strings is helpful for typo prevention. A typo in a variable will
raise an error where the variable was misspelled, whereas a typo in a string (dictionnary key)
do not nessarily raise an error immediately, making the typo harder to fix.
