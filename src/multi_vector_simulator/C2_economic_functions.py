Module C2 - Economic preprocessing
==================================

Module C2 performs the economic pre-processing of MVS' input parameters.
It includes basic economic formulas.

Functionalities:
- Calculate annuity factor
- calculate crf depending on year
- calculate specific lifetime capex, considering replacement costs and residual value of the asset
- calculate annuity from present costs
- calculate present costs based on annuity
- calculate effective fuel price cost, in case there is a annual fuel price change (this functionality still has to be checked in this module)

    """
    Calculates the capital expenditures, also known as CapEx.

    CapEx represent the total funds used to acquire or upgrade an asset.
    The specific capex is calculated by taking into account all future cash flows connected to the investment into one unit of the asset.
    This includes reinvestments, operation and management costs, dispatch costs as well as a deduction of the residual value at project end.
    The residual value is calculated with a linear depreciation of the last investment, ie. as a even share of the last investment over
    the lifetime of the asset. The remaining value of the asset is translated in a present value and then deducted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    investment_t0: float
        first investment at the beginning of the project made at year 0
    lifetime: int
